    "- For this we need something call **causal inferencing**.\n",
    "- We denote $Y^a$ as the outcome that would have been observed if treatment was set to $A = a$. In the context of causal inferencing, there are two possible actions that can be applied to an individual. $1$, treatment; $0$, control. Hence $Y^1$ denotes the outcome if the treatment was applied, whereas $Y^0$ measures the outcome if individual was under the control group.\n",
    "- The reason why it isn't a proper causal effect is because it's only telling us $Y^1=1$. It doesn't tell us what would have happened had we not taken ibuprofen, $Y^0=?$. And we can only state that there is a causal effect if $Y^1 \\neq Y^0$.\n",

    "- However, with certain assumptions, we can estimate population level causal effects. \n",
    "- In other words, it is possible for us to answer questions such as: what would the rate of headache remission be if everyone took ibuprofen when they had a headache versus if no one did.\n",

    "- What this means is: Imagine a hypothetical world where our entire population received treatment $A=0$. Versus, some other hypothetical world where everyone received the other treatment, $A=1$. The most important thing here is the two hypothetical world should have the exact same population. The only difference is the difference in our treatment. If we were able to observe both of these worlds simultaneously, we could collect the outcome data from everyone in the populations, and then compute average difference.\n",
    "- Of course, in reality, **we're not** going to see both of these worlds, but this is what we're hoping to estimate.\n",
    "- In reality, what we get from an experiment is $E(Y|A=1)$. Here, we are saying what is the expected value of $Y$ given $A=1$. An equivalent way of reading this is the expected value of $Y$ restricting to the sub-population who actually had $A=1$. The main point that we're getting at is:\n",

    "E(Y^1 - Y^0) \\neq E(Y|A=1) - E(Y|A=0)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",

    "- The reason being the sub-population might differ from the whole population in important ways. e.g. People at higher risk for the flu might be more likely to get the flu shot. Then if we take the expected value of $Y$ among people who actually got the flu shot, we're taking expected value of $Y$ among a higher risk population. And this will most likely be different than the expected value of the potential outcome $Y^1$ because $Y^1$ is the outcome if everyone in the whole population got treatment, i.e. it's not restricting to a sub-population.\n",
    "- We could of course still compute $E(Y|A=1) - E(Y|A=0)$, but we need to keep in mind that the people who received treatment $A=0$ might differ in fundamental ways from people who got treatment $A=1$. So we haven't isolated a treatment effect, because these are different people, and they might have different characteristics in general. So that's why this distinction between the two are very important. The causal effect where we're manipulating treatment on the same group of people versus what we actually observe, which is the difference in means among some populations that are defined by treatment.\n",
    "- In short, the take home message from this paragraph is that $E(Y|A=1) - E(Y|A=0)$ is generally not a causal effect, because it is comparing two different populations of people.\n",

    "\n",
    "- To do so, we'll need make some assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our observed data typically consists of an outcome, $Y$, a treatment variable $A$, and then some set of covariates $X$ (additional information that we may wish to collect for individuals in the studies). The assumptions that we'll make are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA):** Not interference between units. Treatment assignment of one unit does not affect the outcome of another unit. Same sentence but phrased a bit differently: When we assign somebody a treatment how effective that is isn't dependent on what is happening with other people\n",
    "- **Positivity Assumption:** For every set of values for $X$, treatment assignment was not deterministic: $P(A=a|X=x) > 0$ for all $a$ and $x$. This assumption ensures we can have some data at every level of $X$ for people who are treated and not treated. The reason we need this assumption is: if for a given value of $X$, everybody would/wouldn't treated, then there's really no way for us to learn what would've happened if they were/weren't treated. In some cases where people with certain diseases might be ineligible for a particular treatment, we wouldn't want to make inference about that population, so we would probably exclude them from the study.\n",
    "- **Ignorability Assumption:** Given pre-treatment covariates $X$, treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcome. $Y^1, Y^0 \\perp A | X$ (here, $\\perp$ denotes independence). So among people with the same values of $X$, we could essentially think of treatment as being randomly assigned. This is also referred to as \"no unmeasured confounders' assumption\".\n",
    "- **Consistency Assumption:** The potential outcome under the treatment $A=a$, $Y^a$ is equivalent to the observed outcome $Y$, if the actual treatment received is $A=a$. i.e. $Y = Y^a \\text{ if } A=a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given the assumptions above, we can link our observe data to potential outcomes. Given that we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "E(Y | A=a, X=x)\n",
    "&= E(Y^a | A=a, X=x) \\text{ due to consistency} \\\\ \n",
    "&= E(Y^a | X=x) \\text{ due to ignorability}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "- To elaborate on the ignorability assumption, the assumption said that conditional on the set of covariates $X$, the treatment assignment mechanism doesn't matter, it's just random. So, in other words, conditioning on $A$ isn't providing us any additional information about the mean of the potential outcome here.\n",

The distributional difference between the propensity scores for the two group justifies the need for matching, since they are not directly comparable otherwise.\n",
    "- Although, there's a distributional difference in the density plot, but in this case, what we see is that there's overlap everywhere, so this is actually the kind of plot we would like to see if we're going to do propensity score matching. What we mean by overlap is that no matter where we look on the plot, even though there might be more control than treatment or vice versa, there will still be some subject from either group. The notion of overlap means that our positivity assumption is probably reasonable. Remember positivity refers to the situation where all of the subjects in the study have at least some chance of receiving either treatment. And that appears to be the case here, hence this would be a situation where we would feel comfortable to proceed with our propensity score matching.\n",

    "Keep in mind that not every plot will look like this, if there's major lack of overlap in some part of the propensity score distribution plot that means our positivity assumption would essentially be violated. Or in other words, we can't really estimate a causal effect in those area of the distribution since in those areas, those are subjects that have close to zero chance of being in the control/treatment group. One thing that we may wish to do when encountered with this scenario is either look and see if we're missing some covariates or get rid of individuals who have extreme propensity scores and focus on the areas where there are strong overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to perform matching. In general, the procedure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We compute the distance between the estimated propensity score for each treated subject with every control. And for every treated subject we would find the subject in the control that has the closest distance to it. These pairs are \"matched\" together and will be included in the final dataset that will be used to estimate the causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in practice there are actually many different variants to performing the step mentioned above. e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: We mentioned that when there's a lack of balance, we can get rid of individuals who have extreme propensity scores. Some example of doing this includes removing control subjects whose propensity score is less than the minimum in the treatment group and removing treated subjects whose propensity score is greater than the maximum in the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second: Some people would only consider the treatment and control subject to be a match if the difference between their propensity score difference is less than a specified threshold, $\\delta$ (this threshold is also referred to as caliper). In other words, given a user in the treatment group, $u_t$, we find the set of candidate matches from the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "C(u_t) = \\{ u_c \\in {\\text control} : |\\pi_{u_c} - \\pi_{u_t}| \\leq \\delta \\}\n",

To account for this, we can add a weighting to each matched record with the inverse of its frequency. i.e. if a control group user occurred 4 times in the matched dataset, we assigned that record a weight of 1/4. We may wish to check whether duplicates occurs a lot in the final matched dataset. Some implementation gives a flag whether this multiple matched control group scenario is allowed, i.e. whether matching with replacement is allowed. If replacement is not allowed, then matches generally will be found in the same order as the data are sorted. Thus, the match(es) for the first observation will be found first, the match(es) for the second observation will be found second, etc. Matching without replacement will generally increase bias.\n",
